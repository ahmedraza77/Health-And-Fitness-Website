Get fit in the Gym Lose Weight in the kitchen

Fit is not a destination it is a way of life

hustle for that muscle

Number of pounds you shed or how much bulk you can put on.
Fitness is beyond the physical. It is a way of life. It shapes 
character, it cultivates discipline and it instills conscious
living.It's not about perfect. It's about effort. And when you 
bring that effort every single day, that's where transformation
happens. That's how change occurs.

Running, cheaper than therapy
Sore, the most satisfying pain
